    "title": "LLM-Empowered BSS Optimization Framework: Agent Engineering & Base Station Siting",
    "summary": "The Llm-Empowered Bss Optimization Framework (Paper id 153) explores the application of advanced large language model (LLM)\u2013based agents to optimize base station siting (BSS). It discusses two core topics\u2014Agent Engineering (id 156) and Base Station Siting (id 154)\u2014and employs four primary methods: an autonomous BSS agent (Laba, id 163), cooperative multiple agents (Claba, id 164), drive testing (id 159), and user feedback (id 160). Relationships among these entities reveal how each method supports specific topics, demonstrating a structured approach to integrating LLM capabilities into telecom network optimization [Data: Entities (153, 156, 154, 163, 164, 159, 160); Relationships (226, 223, 233, 234, 229, 230)].",

This document serves as the nexus for all topic and method relationships, indicating its foundational role in the community\u2019s research agenda [Data: Entities (153)].\n\nAll subsequent topics and methods are directly linked to this paper, confirming that it orchestrates the integration of Agent Engineering and BSS concepts with novel LLM implementations. This centralization underscores the paper\u2019s importance for any decision-maker assessing LLM deployment in telecom optimization [Data: Relationships (223, 226, 233, 234, 229, 230)]."

Both methods are related to Base Station Siting (Topic id 154), reinforcing their role in validating and iterating BSS decisions [Data: Relationships (236, 237)]."
