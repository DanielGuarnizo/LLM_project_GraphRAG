    "title": "Prompt Design and Engineering: Core Paper and Advanced Methods",
    "summary": "The community is anchored by the paper \u201cPrompt Design and Engineering\u201d which serves as a hub connecting two advanced reasoning methods\u2014Chain-Of-Thought and Reflection\u2014and three key topical areas: Core Concepts, Tools for Prompt Engineers, and Principles Behind Building LLM-Based Agents. Chain-Of-Thought further links to Complex Reasoning Tasks and Multi-Agent Systems, the latter extending to Multi-Agent LLMs, illustrating a tightly integrated exploration of sophisticated prompt engineering strategies.",
