    "summary": "The Agreemate paper (Entity 70) explores Strategic Price Negotiations using multiple natural language processing techniques. It discusses both the high-level negotiation setting and the broader domain of Natural Language, and it employs four distinct methods\u2014Decoupled Modular Bargaining Architecture, Fine-Tuning, Chain-of-Thought Prompting, and Attention Probing\u2014to model and analyze bargaining behaviors.",
