    "title": "Helper: Retrieval-Augmented LLM Prompting for Free-Form Human-Robot Dialogue",
    "summary": "The community centers on the \u201cHelper\u201d paper, which integrates multiple LLM prompting methods\u2014Pre-Trained and Frozen LLMs, Few-Shot Example Prompting, Retrieval-Augmented LLM Prompting, and External Memory of Language-Program Pairs\u2014to advance free-form human-robot dialogue research. These methods are interrelated, with retrieval-augmented prompting linked to external memory and dialogue, and few-shot prompting connected to pre-trained LLMs.",
    "rating": 7.2,
    "rating explanation": "The community\u2019s novel combination of retrieval-augmented prompting and external memories for interactive dialogue presents significant potential impact on human-robot interaction research.",
