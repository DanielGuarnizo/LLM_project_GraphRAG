        "summary": "Development of Postline platform based on Ann Arbor Architecture",
        "explanation": "Postline is an agent training platform designed atop the Ann Arbor Architecture, facilitating experimental evaluation of multi-agent coordination in prompt engineering. Its implementation demonstrates the practical viability of the proposed architecture [Data: Entities (13); Relationships (11,14)]."

      {
        "summary": "Application of Conquer And Merge method in agent training",
        "explanation": "The Conquer And Merge method is employed by the paper to structure agent interactions, breaking tasks into subproblems and recombining results. This method complements the Ann Arbor Architecture by providing a systematic approach to collaborative problem solving [Data: Entities (25); Relationships (27,37)]."
