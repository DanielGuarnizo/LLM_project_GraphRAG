    "title": "Promptagentpaper Research Community",
    "summary": "The community centers on the research paper \u201cPromptagentpaper,\u201d which integrates four optimization methods (Trial-And-Error Exploration; Error Feedback; Monte Carlo Tree Search; and the novel Promptagentmethod) to craft high-quality, expert-level prompts. It evaluates these methods on three datasets (Big-Bench Hard; General NLP Tasks; Domain-Specific Tasks) and discusses core topics including Task-Specific Prompts, Domain Knowledge, and Expert-Level Prompts, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to autonomous prompt engineering.",
    "rating": 6.2,
    "rating explanation": "The community presents innovative technical contributions in prompt optimization with moderate application scope and research impact.",
