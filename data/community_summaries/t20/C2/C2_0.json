Purpose and Scope  \nThe \u201cDrama Engine\u201d community revolves around a newly proposed framework (Paper ID 185) that leverages large language models (LLMs) in an agentive, collaborative manner to support and enrich narrative creation. Its central aim is to define how LLM-based agents can interact with authors (and each other) to produce more engaging, adaptive story experiences.\n\n2. Core Topics  \n  \u2022 Narrative Purposes (ID 187)  \n     \u2013 How story goals, character arcs, and plot dynamics can be formulated and optimized through LLM agents.  \n  \u2022 Agentic Interaction (ID 186)  \n     \u2013 The mechanisms by which autonomous or semi-autonomous LLM agents perceive, decide, and act within the storytelling process.\n\n3. Methodological Foundations  \n  \u2022 Companion Development (ID 191)  \n     \u2013 Techniques for training conversational LLM \u201ccompanions\u201d that assist authors by suggesting twists, maintaining character consistency, or improvising scenes.  \n  \u2022 Mood Systems (ID 192)  \n     \u2013 Models for tracking and influencing narrative tone and emotional trajectories over the course of a story.  \n  \u2022 Multi-Agent System Principles (ID 188)  \n     \u2013 Architectural guidelines for coordinating multiple LLM agents, balancing autonomy with coherence, and managing inter-agent communication.\n\n4. Interrelationships  \n  \u2013 Companion Development and Mood Systems directly support the Narrative Purposes dimension, framing how stories evolve in response to author input and emotional context.  \n  \u2013 Multi-Agent System Principles form the backbone of the Agentic Interaction dimension, ensuring that multiple narrative agents can operate smoothly, negotiate story decisions, and resolve conflicts.\n\n5. Key Findings  \n  \u2022 The Drama Engine framework offers a structured way to integrate LLMs into narrative workflows, moving beyond one-off prompts toward sustained, goal-driven collaboration.  \n  \u2022 Distinct methodological layers allow teams to specialize: some focus on character and mood, others on system-level coordination.  \n  \u2022 By separating \u201cwhat\u201d stories aim to achieve (Narrative Purposes) from \u201chow\u201d agents collaborate (Agentic Interaction), the framework promotes modularity, extensibility, and clearer evaluation metrics.\n\nConclusion  \nThe Drama Engine represents a significant step toward systematizing LLM-based storytelling: it clarifies the roles of interactive agents, delineates the narrative vs. interaction dimensions, and proposes concrete methods for building and managing those agents. Future work will likely explore toolkits for rapid deployment, evaluation benchmarks for narrative quality, and user studies to validate collaborative benefits."
