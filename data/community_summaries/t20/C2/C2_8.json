A Method node representing \u201cVirtual Neural Network Emulation\u201d  \n\nThey are linked by a single, direct relationship indicating that the emulation method is specifically tailored to the virtual neural network topic. The simplicity of this structure\u2014with both nodes playing central roles\u2014highlights a very narrow yet well\u2010defined research area: applying emulation techniques directly to virtual neural networks."
