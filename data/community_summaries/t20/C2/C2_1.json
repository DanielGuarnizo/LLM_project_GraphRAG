At its core lies the \u201cPromptagentpaper,\u201d which compares and combines four distinct methods\u2014Trial-And-Error Exploration, Error Feedback, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and a newly introduced Promptagentmethod\u2014to generate expert-quality prompts autonomously. These techniques are rigorously evaluated across three types of benchmarks (Big-Bench Hard, general NLP tasks, and domain-specific tasks), ensuring both breadth and depth of assessment. Key thematic areas include: task-specific prompt design, integration of domain knowledge, and the pursuit of expert-level prompting capabilities.\n\nKey Findings  \n\u2022 Central research artifact: the \u201cPromptagentpaper\u201d consolidating multiple optimization approaches  \n\u2022 Four optimization methods examined and integrated into a unified framework  \n\u2022 Evaluation on three complementary datasets (benchmark, general NLP, domain-specific)  \n\u2022 Emphasis on task customization, domain expertise, and advanced prompting strategies  \n\u2022 Introduction of an autonomous Promptagentmethod that outperforms or complements existing techniques"
