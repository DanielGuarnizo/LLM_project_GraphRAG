It leverages:\n\n  \u2022 Pre-Trained, Frozen LLMs as a stable backbone  \n  \u2022 Few-Shot Example Prompting to guide the model via illustrative dialogue snippets  \n  \u2022 Retrieval-Augmented Prompting to dynamically inject relevant knowledge during interaction  \n  \u2022 An External Memory of Language\u2013Program Pairs that bolsters the retrieval component and preserves context across turns  \n\nBy weaving these methods together, \u201cHelper\u201d creates an interactive pipeline in which few-shot prompting refines the frozen LLM\u2019s general capabilities, retrieval augmentation supplies real-time, task-specific information, and external memory ensures continuity over extended conversations. This integrated approach both simplifies system design\u2014through clearly defined, interchangeable modules\u2014and maximizes flexibility for a wide range of human-robot dialogue applications. Early findings indicate that such a modular architecture effectively balances the strengths of each prompting technique, paving the way for more natural, context-aware, and scalable conversational agents."
