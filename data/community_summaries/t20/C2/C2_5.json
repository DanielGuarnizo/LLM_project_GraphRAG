It bridges the domains of Automated Prompt Engineering and Natural Language Prompts by casting prompt design as an optimal\u2010learning problem. Central to this framework is an iterative, data\u2010driven approach that leverages advanced statistical and optimization techniques to discover high\u2010quality prompts with minimal human intervention.\n\nKey Findings:  \n\u2022 Central Role of the Paper  \n  \u2013 Serves as the hub connecting two core topics and four methodological strands.  \n\u2022 Topics Addressed  \n  \u2013 Automated Prompt Engineering: formalizing prompt discovery as an automated process.  \n  \u2013 Natural Language Prompts: using interpretable, human\u2010readable templates.  \n\u2022 Methodological Approaches  \n  \u2013 Knowledge-Gradient Policy: guides exploration of the prompt space under uncertainty.  \n  \u2013 Bayesian Regression: models the relationship between prompt features and task performance.  \n  \u2013 Feature-Based Prompt Expression: encodes prompts via explicit, descriptive attributes.  \n  \u2013 Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Optimization: solves the resulting design problems under complex constraints.  \n\nCollectively, these elements form an integrated framework that advances both the theory and practice of prompt engineering by uniting learning\u2010based guidance with rigorous optimization."
