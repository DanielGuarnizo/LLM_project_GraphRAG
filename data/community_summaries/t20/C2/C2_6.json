The \u201cLLM-Empowered BSS Optimization Framework\u201d (Paper 153) presents a systematic approach to harnessing LLM-based agents for the classic telecom problem of base-station siting (BSS).\n\nCore Topics  \n1. Agent Engineering (Topic 156)  \n2. Base Station Siting (Topic 154)\n\nMethods  \n1. Autonomous BSS Agent (Laba, Method 163)  \n   \u2022 A single LLM-driven agent designed to propose and refine cell-site locations based on signal-coverage goals and constraints.  \n2. Cooperative Multi-Agent System (Claba, Method 164)  \n   \u2022 Multiple specialized agents collaborate\u2014one may survey geographic data, another optimizes coverage, a third handles cost trade-offs\u2014yielding more robust recommendations.  \n3. Drive Testing (Method 159)  \n   \u2022 Field measurements of signal strength and quality to validate and calibrate agent outputs.  \n4. User Feedback (Method 160)  \n   \u2022 Crowdsourced performance reports to iteratively refine site proposals and improve real-world applicability.\n\nFindings  \n\u2022 The autonomous Laba agent effectively generates initial BSS layouts, demonstrating LLMs\u2019 capacity for technical problem solving.  \n\u2022 Introducing cooperative agents (Claba) leads to more nuanced designs by distributing tasks among specialized LLM instances.  \n\u2022 Drive tests and user feedback serve as critical, complementary data sources\u2014ground-truthing agent recommendations and guiding incremental improvements.  \n\u2022 Mapping methods to topics reveals a clear modular workflow: agent-engineering advances feed directly into improved siting strategies, while empirical validation loops enhance both.\n\nImplications  \nThis framework illustrates a structured, end-to-end pipeline for integrating LLMs into telecom network planning. By combining autonomous and cooperative agent architectures with field-level validation, it paves the way for more adaptive, data-driven BSS processes. Future work may extend this model to real-time network reconfiguration, multi-operator scenarios, or cross-domain infrastructure planning."
