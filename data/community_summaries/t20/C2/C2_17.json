  "summary": "Community 18 is dedicated to exploring how symbolic learning techniques can drive the development of adaptive, self-modifying agents. At its core lies the \u201cAgent Symbolic Learning Algorithm\u201d method, which is explicitly designed to enable agents to evolve their behavior and internal representations over time. This method is tightly coupled with the community\u2019s central topic\u2014\u201cSelf-Evolving Agents\u201d\u2014reflecting a concerted research effort on agents that can autonomously refine their own decision-making processes. \n\nKey aspects of this community include:\n\u2022 A clearly defined method entity (Agent Symbolic Learning Algorithm) that encapsulates the procedural and representational tools for symbolic learning  \n\u2022 A focused topic entity (Self-Evolving Agents) that frames the broader goals of agent autonomy and continuous self-improvement  \n\u2022 A direct method\u2013topic relationship underscoring the community\u2019s narrow but deep research agenda  \n\nTogether, these elements position Community 18 at the intersection of symbolic AI and adaptive systems, with the ultimate aim of creating agents that not only learn from symbolic structures but also evolve their capabilities without external intervention."
