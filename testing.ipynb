Recent research has explored higher-order ToM and its implications for artificial intelligence systems, highlighting the limitations in current large language models' ability to perform well on such tasks. Strategies like Simulation Theory and frameworks like SimToM have been proposed to improve LLMs' ToM capabilities, showing promising results for future research in this area.\n"
