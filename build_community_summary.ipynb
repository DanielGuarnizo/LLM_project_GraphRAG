Within each family sit a variety of concrete algorithms, frameworks and engineering practices.  \\n\\n1. Reinforcement-Learning and Game-Theoretic Approaches  \\n   • Multi-agent RL: independent Q-learning, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), actor-critic and policy-gradient variants  \\n   • Game-theoretic analysis: Nash‐equilibrium computation, fictitious play, strategic bargaining (e.g. Nash-bargaining protocols)  \\n   • Tree-search methods: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) when agents face combinatorial or game‐like decision spaces  \\n\\n2. Distributed Optimization and Task-Allocation  \\n   • Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) and related message-passing solvers  \\n   • Auction- and market-based allocation (incl. Contract Net Protocols)  \\n   • Decoupled modular architectures for negotiation (e.g. modular bargaining frameworks)  \\n\\n3. Coordination, Communication and Consensus  \\n   • Explicit coordination protocols: negotiation schemes, delegation mechanisms, contract nets  \\n   • Consensus and agreement algorithms: flooding, gossip, leader-election, voting schemes  \\n   • Multi-Agent Discussion frameworks and “Conquer-and-Merge” styles of iterative consensus  \\n\\n4. Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation  \\n   • Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) toolkits for large‐scale simulation design  \\n   • Scenario and environment generation driven by structured datasets  \\n   • Integration of empirical testing (e.g. drive tests, user‐in‐the‐loop experiments)  \\n\\n5. LLM-Empowered and Prompt-Based Techniques  \\n   • Prompt engineering variants: few-shot/example prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, iterative reflection  \\n   • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and external memory modules to pull in context at runtime  \\n   • Question-Answering and dialogue‐style agent APIs built on frozen or fine-tuned pretrained LLMs  \\n   • Hybrid workflows that generate or configure ABM/simulation code from LLM outputs  \\n\\n6.
